# Completions are VENDORED into ./shell-completion (tracked in git), not generated during the
# release build. Generating them needs complgen (a Rust build), fish, and bash >= 5 -- none of which
# ship with macOS, and setup.sh resets PATH so a Homebrew bash 5 isn't visible either. That made
# build-release.sh unrunnable on a stock machine to produce three files that change only when
# grammar/commands-bnf-grammar.txt changes.
#
# So: run this script by hand after editing the grammar, and commit the result. build-release.sh
# just copies ./shell-completion.
#
# ponytail: drift between the grammar and the vendored output is caught by a human, not CI --
# CI would have to `cargo install --git` complgen on every run. Add a cached CI job if it ever
# actually drifts.
