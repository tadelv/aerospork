/// setting that can permanently hide the thing that undoes it is a trap, not a preference.

/// for a clean menu bar gets a clean menu bar, and pays for it with a Dock icon. Forcing the *menu
/// bar* icon back instead would silently ignore the only toggle they touched. The GUI says so next
/// to the toggle, and `aerospork open-settings` is documented there as the escape hatch either way.

/// external editor during a pause only lands when tiling resumes or any command runs (`runSession`
