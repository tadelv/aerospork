/// that differed only by font, plus two chip variants that differed only by whether *invisible*
/// workspaces were appended at 60% opacity -- which, on a 4-monitor setup, is a menu bar full of
/// grey squares for workspaces you are not looking at. What survives is the one that answers the
/// only question the menu bar can answer at a glance: which workspace is on each monitor, and
/// which of them has focus.

/// 0...50 and single capital letters, so a config with a workspace named `web` used to get a
