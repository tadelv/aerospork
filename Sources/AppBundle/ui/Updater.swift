/// AeroSpork cannot ship through the App Store: it drives other applications' windows through the
/// Accessibility APIs, which do not work in a sandbox, and it reads window ids through a private
/// symbol. So there is no store update mechanism to inherit. A window manager that silently goes
/// stale is worse than one that asks, so it checks a signed appcast itself.
///
/// The updater is only meaningful in a release build. A debug build has no `SUFeedURL` in its
/// Info.plist (`resources/Info-Debug.plist` deliberately omits it), so Sparkle would look up
/// nothing; `isEnabled` reflects that rather than showing a control that cannot work.
