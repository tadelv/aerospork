/// Which workspace a monitor shows when nothing has been put on it.
///
/// The rule that matters: it must be a workspace the user can reach from the keyboard. The invent-a-
/// name fallback counts up from 1 and skips every bound name, so a config binding `1-9` produced
/// `10` -- a workspace with no keybinding, sitting on a monitor in front of the user.
///
/// Scope: these cover the *fresh pick*. `getStubWorkspace` first tries the monitor's previously
/// visible workspace, then any existing workspace whose windows already belong to this monitor --
/// deliberately including occupied ones, since showing a monitor its own windows back is the point.
/// Only when neither applies does the choice below happen.
